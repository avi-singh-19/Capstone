This is Avi's capstone project for Harvard CS50's Web Programming with Python and Javascript course. This project uses Python and Javascript to handle the
website's back and front end capabilities. Originally, the first designs involved making the website into a professional, portfolio style website with personal details of
Avi's professional career so far and some details of his personal interests. However, for a bit of fun and to add some complexity to the application, Avi remade his
stock price lookup and plot tool that he submitted as part of CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python to incorporate into this website with some added
functionality and more user-friendly error handling, and he made a clone of the free online word game 'Wordle', but with new words every single game to keep you playing
all day. More details about the application's functionality, the technical Python and Javascript details and the types of tests undertaken can be found in the committed
'README' file on the project GitHub repository. Avi hopes you enjoy looking around this web app.
