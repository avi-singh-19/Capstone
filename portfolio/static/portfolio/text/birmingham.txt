Avi's passion for engineering, logic and computer science led him to study Electronic and Electrical Engineering at the University of Birmingham, one of the UK's leading engineering schools.
During his first year studying at university, Avi learned fundamental programming language skills in C, scoring a first class grade in 'Introduction to Programming for Engineers with C', and from there
he continued his studies taking a liking to the programming parts of the university's course. As a result, Avi ended up completing his final project in Python, where he used a Raspberry Pi and a camera module to
create a portable facial recognition system which was designed to be a hands free, COVID safe security mechanism for the engineering laboratories. Avi graduated with a 2:1 grade in the summer of 2022.
