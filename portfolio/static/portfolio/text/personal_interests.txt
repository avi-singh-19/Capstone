Outside of software and his tech job, Avi loves old school mechanical engineering and he loves all the things that move.
He loves cars, he always finds planes fascinating and strongly considered studying both mechanical and aeronautical
engineering before settling on electrical engineering. Avi also loves the great outdoors, he can be found admiring a good
countryside view or on a hike somewhere. To see some photos, please use the blue button.
