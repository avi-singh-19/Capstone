**Complexities:**

This project reuses the navbar element from previous projects but has unique features that separate it. These include:
1) Javascript used to fade elements into view for a more professional looking website
2) Bootstrap elements used to ensure mobile scalability, including manual testing on mobile device (for demo)
3) Use of yfinance API to implement stock and commodity lookup tool
4) Use of model to log search history for previous commodity searches
5) Error handling in place to deal with invalid commodity searches with user focussed error message displays
6) Use of plotly library to plot price graph chart with ability to manipulate and download as a png
7) Javascript used to create interactive Wordle game
8) Wordle Javascript code is able to draw up 5 word grid, reject invalid words, accept valid words, give clues as to correct letters and display the user with a game won/lost
